# Frontend Nanodegree Arcade Game

## Introduction

The Front End Nanodegree Arcade Game is a project developed for the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program at Udacity.
The game's design was stablished by our mentors, but the app.js code was fully developed by me, as well as features from index.html and style.css

## Contributing

As this is my first app coding, you may find that many of the loops and code could probably be better, so once the project gets submitted and hopefully approved, feel free to contribute with anything that optimizes code or even helps me improve my coding skills welcome!

## Usability

All game components are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers without any installation required.
keyboard arrows must be used to move across de board.

Good luck and give it your best try!!
